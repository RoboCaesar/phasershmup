I've wanted to get better at using JavaScript, so this project gives me an excuse to do so.
This (as of now) untitled game will involve controlling a small ship, shooting down enemies, and collecting powerups and reward tokens.

Frameworks used so far: 
Phaser (https://phaser.io/)


Future plans: I hope to have some kind of high score database.
